# Rating

The calculator, a basic mathematical tool, has several limitations and areas for improvement. Its user interface lacks visual polish and sophistication, with plain buttons and a simplistic layout that may not appeal to modern design standards. It lacks robust error handling mechanisms, which may result in unexpected behavior or crashes if users input invalid or nonsensical data. The calculator offers a decent range of mathematical functions but lacks common features found in more advanced calculators, such as memory functions, scientific notation support, and customizable settings. The code structure could be improved for readability, maintainability, and scalability, with hard-coded values and lack of comments making it difficult for other developers to understand and modify.
