# Rating

The calculator offers basic arithmetic operations and some scientific functions, including division by zero and mathematical errors for large numbers. It has a simple user interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and scientific functions. However, it lacks visual aesthetics and design elements that could improve user experience.
The code structure is structured into event handlers for button clicks and helper methods for performing calculations. However, the logic for handling arithmetic operations could be simplified and made more readable by refactoring repetitive code segments. Variable names like `first_number`, `second_number`, and `oper` are descriptive and intuitive, but some variables could have more descriptive names, such as `plus_min`.
Error handling is lacking for scenarios like division by zero or invalid input, and adding error checks and user feedback would enhance the calculator's robustness and user experience. Code readability could benefit from more comments explaining the purpose of methods and complex logic, and some parts of the code could be refactored to improve readability and reduce redundancy.
The calculator performs calculations efficiently, but there are opportunities to optimize repetitive operations and improve overall performance, especially for complex scientific functions. Overall, with refinements, the calculator could become a more robust and user-friendly application.
